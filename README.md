# Robot Tic-Tac-Toe 

In order to understand the Reinforcement Learning Concept and Inverse Kinematic Concept, I developed this personal project titled Robot Tic-Tac-Toe. The project consists of a robotic hand and a game agent. The players of the game are the user and the game agent. The first move is of the user and when he makes the move in the physical board, the game agent identifies the move with the aid of the computer vision. Then the agent decided his move and with the help of the robotic hand, he will the place the token in the preferred location. This project was developed using Python along with OpenCV library.

Note :- The robot hand section not implemented yet
